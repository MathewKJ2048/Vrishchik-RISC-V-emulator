pipelining
data forwarding
deal with data integration (stack pointer)

compiler:

GUI:
make font change at runtime
button placement for licence accepting
disable executestep during ecall
base for decompiled code
put bin and decompiled separately in compile tab
breakpoints

Environment:

Documentation:
features
example programs
commenting source code
how to install/run
how to use
syntax commands
syntax general
syscall codes
registers
guide to code



ideas:
successful compilation - would you like to overwrite binary?
get current path (installer???)
generate report, not emulate
font size adjustor for general font?? need to check to make sure that centering is not ruined. Maybe let the user edit config (boolean change_font)
