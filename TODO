pipelining
data forwarding
deal with data integration (stack pointer)

compiler:
get rid of xor in data section

GUI:
make font change at runtime
button placement for licence accepting
authors and licence
decide help section stuff
memory addresses base

Environment:

Documentation:
features
example programs
commenting source code
how to install/run
how to use
syntax commands
syntax general
guide to code



ideas:
get current path (installer???)
font size adjustor for general font?? need to check to make sure that centering is not ruined. Maybe let the user edit config (boolean change_font)
give pipeline result, don't simulate it
