<h1> Ecall codes </h1>
<p>
The environment may be invoked by the use of the <b>ecall</b> command. 
This is useful for tasks like writing output to and reading input from the console.
The ecall codes used are unique to the Vrishchik environment.

The ecall code is stored in <b>$a2</b><br>
<br>

If the argument for base is 0, base ten is assumed by default.
If the length of the string to be printed is -1, the characters are printed till the null character is reached.
